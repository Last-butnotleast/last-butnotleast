title: Finally Getting Started – My Journey into Solo Projects
---

## Hey, I’m Tom

I’m a 26-year-old software developer from Germany who’s into way too many things—coding, sustainable building, 3D printing, and more. I co-founded a software company, but I’ve always had this itch to do my own stuff on the side.

Procrastination and ADHD haven’t exactly helped, but here I am, finally starting.

## Why Now?

I’ve been putting this off for ages. Right now, I’m spending three months in Southeast Asia, mostly working on my company with some time off in between. Being here gave me the push I needed to finally get serious about my own projects.

## My First Project: A Modern Japanese Learning App

I’m kicking things off with a project I’ve wanted to do for a while—a Japanese learning app. But it’s not your typical language app. This one’s all about making learning fun and actually sticking to it.

What makes it different?

- **Mnemonics:** Clever tricks to help remember things easier.
- **Anime references:** Because learning should be fun, right?
- **Effort-based progress tracking:** It’s not just about speed, but sticking with it.

## What This Blog is About

This blog is where I’ll share my journey—successes, failures, and all the weird stuff in between. Expect updates on my projects, thoughts on software development, experiments in sustainable living, and whatever DIY ideas I decide to chase.

No glossy success stories here—just figuring things out as I go.

## What’s Next?

- More updates on my Japanese learning app.
- Diving into new ideas and tech.
- Hopefully building some really cool stuff.

Let’s see where this goes!
